# Food Picker

![]()

Food Picker is an application for people who probably wrestle with one of the toughest questions in life… Where should I have food? Food picker is the tool to answer this question. It can be super simple and pick from a range of options we know you like at random, or more complex — pulling in data from Google, Zomato Reviews and taking into account: location, price, and type of cuisine.
